##     <p align = "left"> Introduction üìö </p>

This project is a web application that perform object detection on images. It marks the objects location with bounding boxes along with the object label and confidence level. 
YOLOv3 is used in this model for detecting objects. It can detect 80 different objects. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm which can detect multiple 
objects present in the image in real-time.
<br>

##     <p align = "left"> Features ‚≠ê </p>
 -  Real-time detection of different objects.
 -  Utilizes the powerful YOLOv3 model for object detection.

<br>

##     <p align = "left"> Installation and Usage üõ†Ô∏è </p>
1. Clone this repository to your local machine .
2. Download the weight for YOLOv3 with link given in get_weights.txt .
3. Run the script 'app.py'
4. Open the program in web browser by pressing 'CTRL + left click' on the link.
5. After brower gets open, choose the image on which you want to perform object detection.
6. Then press on upload.
